# Coursera course

A MERN Stack, Backend written in Node.JS and from the coursera course "Server-side Development with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB".
Frontend is in custom React.JS, I guess the CSS Framework is Chakra UI? 

For managing the states, i used Redux.

I didn't finish the project, it was for practice purpose.
